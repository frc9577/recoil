# recoil
This is the main repository for all software produced by FRC 9577 "Recoil" from Dripping Springs, Texas.

## Repository Structure

### [year]-[competition]

These directories contain competition code for our FRC robot in the given year. The directory contains a single Java project that, when built, represents the code that runs on the robot for that competition.

This repository was created at the start of the 2026 season so you will find full history for files in the "2026-Rebuilt" tree. The repo is also seeded with files from our 2024 and 2025 seasons but these are merely snapshots of the "main" and "development" branches from our prior repos, "robot-code-2024" and "robot-code-2025". Visit the original repositories if you need to find history information for these files.

### prototype_projects

This top-level directory contains prototype, example and experiment projects developed during off-season or while working on a competition robot. Each subdirectory contains a single Java project. Code in this area is not guaranteed to be complete or working.
